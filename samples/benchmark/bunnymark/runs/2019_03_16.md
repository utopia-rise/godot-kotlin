## Benchmark Run - March 16, 2019

### BunnymarkV2

Attempts to draw as many sprites as possible using Sprite nodes.  It calls GetChildren() to iterate over a list of Sprites and sets their positions.  It also updates a Label's text once per frame.  This test aims to be a better emulation of real world api usage than the V1 tests.

### BunnymarkV1 - DrawTexture

Attempts to draw as many sprites to the screen as possible by drawing textures directly with VisualServer.  This test focuses on compute / render performance and avoids making godot api calls.

### BunnymarkV1 - Sprites

Attempts to draw as many sprites to the screen as possible by adding Sprite nodes.  This test focuses on compute / render performance and avoids making godot api calls.
