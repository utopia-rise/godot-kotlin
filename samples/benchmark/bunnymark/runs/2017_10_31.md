## Benchmark Run - October 31, 2017

### BunnymarkV2

Attempts to draw as many sprites as possible using Sprite nodes.  It calls GetChildren() to iterate over a list of Sprites and sets their positions.  It also updates a Label's text once per frame.  This test aims to be a better emulation of real world api usage than the V1 tests.

| GDScript (Release) | 12160            |
| ~~C#/Mono~~       | ~~16000 (encountered errors)~~|

| GDNative (C++)     | 29240            |

### BunnymarkV1 - DrawTexture

Attempts to draw as many sprites to the screen as possible by drawing textures directly with VisualServer.  This test focuses on compute / render performance and avoids making godot api calls.

| Language           | Bunnies Rendered |

| GDScript (Release) | 13820            |

| GDNative (C++)     | 58120            

### BunnymarkV1 - Sprites

Attempts to draw as many sprites to the screen as possible by adding Sprite nodes.  This test focuses on compute / render performance and avoids making godot api calls.

| Language           | Bunnies Rendered |
|--------------------|------------------|
| GDScript (Release) | 11420            |
| C#/Mono            | 19940            |
