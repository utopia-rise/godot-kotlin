You will need either [IntelliJ IDEA](https://jetbrains.com/idea) (Ultimate is preferred but the Community edition works too!) or [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/). The easiest way to install them is via the [JetBrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/) app.


## Kotlin plugin
Regardless of what IDE you choose, you need to install the appropriate Kotlin plugin. This can be done within the IDE (`Settings -> Plugins`). You have to install `Kotlin` plugin for IntelliJ IDEA while install `Kotlin/Native for CLion` plugin for CLion.

## Importing
Once you have the plugin installed, you can start importing your project.

Click `Import Project` and select your project's `build.gradle.kts` file. The IDE will take some time to index your project, but once done you can start coding!
