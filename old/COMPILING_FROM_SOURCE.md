# Compiling from Source

## Cloning and initialising the project
Clone repo on your local machine:
```shell 
git clone https://github.com/utopia-rise/godot-kotlin.git
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## Building
Use `build` gradle task to automatically build all subprojects. All artifacts will be published to your local maven repository.  
You can also build modules independently in this order:
```shell script
./gradlew :tools:api-classes-generator:build
./gradlew :tools:annotations-internal:build -Pplatform=windows/linux/macos/android/ios #(add -ParmArch=arm64/X64) for android and ios build
./gradlew :wrapper:godot-library:build -Pplatform=windows/linux/macos/android/ios #(add -ParmArch=arm64/X64) for android and ios build
./gradlew :wrapper:godot-library-extension:build -Pplatform=windows/linux/macos/ios #(add -ParmArch=arm64/X64) for android and ios build
./gradlew :tools:godot-gradle-plugin:build
./gradlew :tools:godot-annotation-processor:build
./gradlew :tools:kotlin-compiler-plugin:build
./gradlew :tools:kotlin-compiler-native-plugin:build
./gradlew :tools:annotations:build -Pplatform=windows/linux/macos/android/ios #(add -ParmArch=arm64/X64) for android and ios build
```

or you can add the parameter to your `gradle.properties` file if you're supporting only one platform:
```
platform=yourplatformgoeshere
```

## Building the samples
Samples projects are not included in root gradle project, as it is not the way it works for end user. In order to build samples
you have to start `build` task from `samples/games/kotlin` directory or from `samples/coroutines/kotlin` for coroutines sample.
- Build them manually by directly calling the `build` task of the samples from the IDE or through the commandline:  
`cd samples/games/kotlin`  
`./gradlew build -Pplatform=desired_platform`, `desired_platform` can be either `windows`, `linux`, `macos`, `android`, `ios`.  
For android and ios, you have to add `armArch` parameter like:  
`./gradlew build -Pplatform=android -ParmArch=X64`, otherwise it will build `arm64` platform by default. Supported target
are for now `arm64` and `X64`  
or  
`cd samples/coroutines/kotlin`  
`./gradlew kotlin:build -Pplatform=desired_platform` and as for games sample, you can add `-ParmArch=desiredArmArch` if you are building for android or iOS.  

To specify release or debug add: `-PbuildType=RELEASE` by default debug will be built if nothing is specified.

### iOS Signing
 
Also on ios you should add you signing identity, as it is apple requirement, like:
```shell script
./gradlew build -Pplatform=ios -ParmArch=arm64 -PiosSigningIdentity="youridentity"
```
`youridentity` should looks like this : `Apple Development: mail@provider.com (XXXXXXXXXX)`.
You can also add `iosSigningIdentity` parameter to your `gradle.properties`.
